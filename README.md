# flatland-marl

CS4246/5446 Group 20: IPPO vs MAPPO for multi-agent train rescheduling on the
[Flatland ECML 2026 challenge](https://flatland-association.github.io/flatland-book/challenges/ecml2026.html).
See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the project plan.

## Setup

Requires **Python 3.12** and git. Everything runs on CPU.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rndllchw/flatland-marl.git
cd flatland-marl

# 2. Create the venv and install pinned dependencies
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Clone the starter kit and heuristic baseline (pinned commits) into third_party/
bash scripts/setup_third_party.sh
```

Check it worked by running the smoke test. It runs the starter-kit PPO checkpoint and the
deadlock-avoidance heuristic on the sample scenario and compares their scores with the reference
values:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

Expected output (speed will vary by machine):

```
ppo_checkpoint       score 0.730 (expected 0.730)  arrived 6/6 (expected 6)   ... OK
deadlock_heuristic   score 0.513 (expected 0.513)  arrived 6/6 (expected 6)   ... OK
smoke test PASSED
```

Notes:
- `flatland-rl` must stay at **4.2.6** (competition requirement). Don't upgrade it to 4.3.x.
- `third_party/`, `.venv/` and `runs/` are gitignored. Never commit course PDFs.
